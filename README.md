You can try to make a Minecraft Bedrock game very similar to Unreal Engine 5! There are things that are not very similar, not with all RTX texture packs will look good, so Bare Bones RTX texture pack is recommended 

To install, you need to have iObit Unlocker installed, download my `.rtpack` file, open PowerShell as administrator and type ```powershell -c "iwr https://bedrock.graphics/installer | iex"``` then in the window that appears select the game and drag and drop my `.rtpack` file into that window and confirm all the pop ups

Screenshots can be seen in the releases
